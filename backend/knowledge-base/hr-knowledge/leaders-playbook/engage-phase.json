As the student becomes aware of dozens of errors they need to fix, they'd feel that the lesson fee is justifiable and so they book more classes. Gallwey uses the same approach in his early days as a tennis coach. Over time, he saw that when he stepped back and gave his students less feedback, they improved faster. Players would correct obvious mistakes without any guidance. They knew the correct way of playing tennis. They just needed to overcome the habits of the mind getting in the way.",
