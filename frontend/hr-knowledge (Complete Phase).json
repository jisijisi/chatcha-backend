        "When I first dreamt of starting my own business, I was inspired by the love that I have for my family more than anything else. I never imagined that such a simple dream would one day turn into a bigger reality - becoming one of the largest food enterprises in the Philippines. Now, it has become a home to other families as well.",
        "Ever since, we have treated our employees as an extension of our own family. I always believe that when we are able to look after their welfare, they will in turn take care of our business and treat it as their own.",
        "It is for this reason that I urge each one of you to lead your team with the same passion, understanding, and vigor as you do your job. As leaders, you play a vital role in helping us make this home flourish.",
        "Your leadership should inspire your people to be better in what they do believing that it will fulfill their own sense of purpose. I trust that you will be our partner in nurturing the people that we have and in continuously making their stay in our home a truly meaningful one.",
        "Let this playbook be your tool in guiding your people in their journey here in CDO. We depend on you in creating a prosperous home as we continue to remain relevant and evolve as a family that serves a bigger community.",
        "Together, let us strengthen our bond as a family, as one Ka-Republika so that with One Heart and in One Home we will be able to fulfill our purpose and thrive as One CDO, continuously serving our customers and consumers with food that brings them Home."

However, exceptions may be made in very rare cases or under instances when complete evaluation of the employee's performance will not be possible. For emphasis, the extension must be done in good faith, with justification, and must be agreed upon by both the employer and employee. This should be approved by the Division Head and the HRAD Head."

As the student becomes aware of dozens of errors they need to fix, they'd feel that the lesson fee is justifiable and so they book more classes. Gallwey uses the same approach in his early days as a tennis coach. Over time, he saw that when he stepped back and gave his students less feedback, they improved faster. Players would correct obvious mistakes without any guidance. They knew the correct way of playing tennis. They just needed to overcome the habits of the mind getting in the way.",
